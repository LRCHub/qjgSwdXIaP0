A little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit
A little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit
A little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit
A little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit

World don't turn around
Music make no sound
Where is sweetness found
When love is gone?

Sun don't come around
Don't make a sound
Where can love be found
If your heart won't feel?

Shivers up and down my spine
Break up, not on my mind

A little bit, just a little bit
A little bit, just a little bit
A little bit, just a little bit
A little bit, just a little bit

How could it end this way?
Don't leave me, love me
Just a little bit longer

How could it end this way?
Don't leave me, love me
Just a little bit longer

How could it end this way?
Don't leave me, love me
Just a little bit longer

Day don't turn to nights
Morning don't bring lights
Where is sweetness found
When love is gone?

Won't you stay the night?
Let the truth shine bright
Where can love be found
If your heart won't feel?

Memory, motions that we shared
Teardrops signing my face

How could it end this way?
Don't leave me, love me
Just a little bit longer

How could it end this way?
Don't leave me, love me
Just a little bit longer

How could it end this way?
Don't leave me, love me
Just a little bit longer

How could it end this way?
Don't leave me, love me
Just a little bit longer

A little bit, just a little bit
A little bit, just a little bit
