You see the world through your window
You don't even go outside anymore
Only feel safe feeling hollow
You think your scars are way too deep to be cured

You hide your heart in the shadows
So afraid to open up to anyone
But I can see your faded halo
And I can make it burn again, like the sun

If you stay for a while
Let me hold you tonight
Just open your eyes you will see the light

But stay for a while
Let me hold you tonight
Just open your eyes you will see the light shine
You don't have to be frozen
You don't have to be broken tonight

I can see your faded halo
And I can make it burn again, like the sun

Just stay for a while
Let me hold you tonight
Just open your eyes you will see the light shine
You don't have to be frozen
You don't have to be broken

You don't have to be broken tonight
