Leaves are falling on my window
Turning cold in fire, with the wind they go
I lost my way, where do I go now?
This looks just like the road I came down

Take a moment to live
Take a moment to cry
Take a moment to love
And don't ask why

Take a moment to live
Take a moment to cry
Take a moment to love
And don't ask why

Moment to live
Moment to love

A steady hand can point me somewhere
I'm all the wiser for the many wrongs I've done
I've found some courage in my battles won
Never leads me far from where I'm meant to be

Take a moment to live
Take a moment to cry
Take a moment to love
And don't ask why

Take a moment to live
Take a moment to cry
Take a moment to love
And don't ask why

Take a moment to live
Take a moment to cry
Take a moment to love
And don't ask why

My heavy heart, it pulls me
And I know you will be there

Take a moment to live
Take a moment to cry
Take a moment to love
And don't ask why

Take a moment to live
Take a moment to cry
Take a moment to love
And don't ask why

Moment to live
Moment to love

Take a moment to live
Take a moment to cry
Take a moment to love
And don't ask why

Take a moment to live
Take a moment to cry
Take a moment to love
And don't ask why

Moment to live
Moment to love
