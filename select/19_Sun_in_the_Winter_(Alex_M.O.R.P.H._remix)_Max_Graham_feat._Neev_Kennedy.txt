Heating the freezing room
I leave the world behind me, so icy
You muted love without a warning
Now all I hear are distant words of our past

Heating the freezing room
I leave the world behind me, so icy
You muted love without a warning
Now all I hear are distant words of our past

Fooling me like the sun in the winter
Warm for a while, fade away
Taking me in like summer is calling
A promise of love turned a cold surprise

Fooling me like the sun in the winter
Warm for a while, fade away
Taking me in like summer is calling
A promise of love turned a cold suprise
