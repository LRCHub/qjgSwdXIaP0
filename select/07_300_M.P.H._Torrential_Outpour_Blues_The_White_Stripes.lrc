[00:24.85] I'm calling out to ghosts that are no longer there
[00:35.10] I'm gettin' hard on myself, sittin' in my easy chair
[00:45.94] But, there's three people in the mirror
[00:48.67] And I'm wonderin' which one of them I should choose
[00:56.96] And, I can't keep from laughin'
[00:59.36] Spittin' out these 300 mile per hour outpour blues
[01:24.36] 
[01:15.03] I'm breakin' my teeth off tryin' to bite my lip
[01:25.45] There's all kinds of red-headed women that I ain't supposed to kiss
[01:36.45] It's that color which never fails to turn me blue
[01:47.61] So I just swallow it and hold on to it
[01:50.07] And use it to scare the hell out of you
[02:09.57] 
[02:21.88] I have a woman, says "Come and watch me bleed"
[02:32.02] And I'm wonderin' just how I can do that
[02:36.09] And still give her everything that she needs
[02:42.75] See, there's three women in my mind that know
[02:45.21] They have the answer, but they're not letting go
[03:18.34] But is this new I'm the only who seems to care where I should go
[03:50.34] 
[03:27.22] Put on gloves, a tied scarf, and wrap up warm on this winter night
[03:38.58] Every time you get defensive, you're just looking for a fight
[03:49.59] It's safe to say somebody out there's
[03:52.20] Got a problem with almost anything you'll do
[04:00.79] So, next time they stab you, don't fight back
[04:03.13] Just play the victim instead of playin' the fool
[04:27.13] 
[04:17.53] And the roads are covered with a million little molecules
[04:28.49] Of cigarette ashes and the school floors are covered
[04:32.25] With pieces of pencil eraser, too
[04:39.25] Well, sooner or later,
[04:40.50] The ground's gonna be holdin' all of my ashes, too
[04:50.19] But I can't help but wonder if after I'm gone
[04:53.63] Will I still have these 300 mile per hour, finger breaking
[04:57.68] No answers, broken back, dirty cancer, bee stung and busted up
[05:01.66] Empty cup torrential outpour blues
